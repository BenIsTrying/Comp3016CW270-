        This is a very simple way of setting the location for each of the moddels used within the program.
        the way translate works is by setting a loction insid ethe envirment and then drawign each of the modules (this also includes redrawing)
        this means it will draw every mmodule in the same area makign it over crwoded and messy.
        but I have it so it sets a new location after it draws a model so that they can be spaced apart, I also had to include
        a negitiv version of movign the translate location of else each time it redraws it will appare in a further location from the player
        this led to many times my building model would fly away
